      <h2>Check your Password Creation Skill</h2>
      <p>
  Before scrolling, test your password skill using the 
  <a href="https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/" target="_blank">
    Bitwarden site
  </a>
  to see how much time it will take to crack the password you create. But do not use the real passwords you are using. 
</p>
      <h2>Common Mistakes Many People Make</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using the same password for every site</li>
        <li>Using short or guessable passwords like "123456", "unsw2025" or using your personal information such as birthdays</li>
        <li>Storing passwords in notes apps or screenshots</li>
        <li>Never changing your passwords once you set them</li>
        <li>Writing down passwords in places where others can see such as stickypads on your desk 
      </ul>

      <h2>What Makes a Strong Password?</h2>
      <p class="is">
        A strong password is:
        <ul>
          <li>Long ‚Äî at least 12 characters</li>
          <li>Unique ‚Äî not reused anywhere else</li>
          <li>Hard to guess ‚Äî do not include any information about you</li>
          <li>Easy to remember - use passphrase

          </p>
      </ul>

      <h2>Try Creating a Passphrase</h2>
      <p>A passphrase is a combination of random words with at least 14 characters in length, that uses symbols, numbers, and sometimes even a space to represent letters in a word.
      <p>Look around your room, pick four random words you find. Here's an example:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>c0mputer-shirt-bo0k-PEN</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This is strong, memorable, and easy to type! Subsitute some letters with symbols such as @ and 0 to make it more complex!</p>
     <p>
  Now, test your passphrase using the 
  <a href="https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/" target="_blank">
    Bitwarden site
  </a>
  to see how much time it will take to crack it.

    <section>
      <h2>Use Password Managers</h2>
      <p>Memorizing all the unique passwords may sound almost impossible. In that case, use a secure password manager.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank">Bitwarden (Free)</a></li>
        <li>PassWord App (on your Iphone)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These tools can store your passwords, generate new ones, and autofill them securely.
