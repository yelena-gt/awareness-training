    <p>Aki is a first-year university student — and just like many others, she's figuring out how to stay safe online.</p>

        <h2> Starting School</h2>
        <p>
          Aki just started her first semester at a university. She's excited to study International Relations and meet new friends. She has also started living on her own, so she has to set up many new accounts such as university portals, Amazon Prime Student, Netflix, and online banking.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since there are so many passwords she had to create, Aki decided to resue the same password on multiple services for convenience. She has also clicked on a few "urgent" emails from the university and online bank and logged into the website via the links attached to them.

      <h2> What Could Go Wrong?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>She gets phished by an email requiring "urgent" action.</li>
        <li>Her reused password is leaked in a data breach on one service and used elsewhere.</li>
        <li>She connects to a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot labeled “Free_Campus_Wifi”.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2> Consequences</h2>
  <p>After a few weeks, Aki began receiving multiple calls from unknown callers. When she checked her bank account, there were transactions she does not recall making, and her balance was empty. Moreover, one of her friends told her that he found a girl that perfectly matches her identity on a dating up she had never signed up for. Then she realizes somebody is using her personal information. </p>

      <h2>How Aki Got Cyber-Smart</h2>
      <p class="learn">Aki learned to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a password manager to create unique, strong passwords</li>
        <li>Ignore emails with suspicious links or from unknown senders</li>
        <li>Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi and turn off auto-connect</li>
      </ul>
