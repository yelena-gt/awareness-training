      <h2>What’s the Risk?</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone connected to an open or poorly secured Wi-Fi network — like those in cafés, trains, or even university lounges — can potentially intercept your data. It is like reading you password out loud in a room. Attackers can use the information obtained from wifi for <b>identity theft</b>, <b>infecting your device with malware</b>, <b>stealing your passwords</b>, <b>gaining remote control of your device</b>, and once you start working and you connect to a vulnerable wifi in cafés, <b>stealing your business information</b>.

      <h2>Tips to protect yourself</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a VPN</strong>: It encrypts your traffic, even on public networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Stick to HTTPS sites</strong>: Look for the lock icon in the address bar.</li>
        <li><strong>Turn off auto-connect</strong>: Disable automatic Wi-Fi joining on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the names of the Wi-Fi before trusting to connect</strong>: Sometimes hackers publish fake wifi networks that look legitimate. Ex. AirportWIFI#?
      <li><strong>Use antivirus</strong>: this will scan malware and virus.</li>
      <li><strong>Do not share files</strong>: Hackers can intercept your communication through wifi network. Do not share files containing information that you do not want others to see.</li>
      </ul>
