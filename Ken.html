          Kenji is a second-year economics student who commutes two hours daily. He checks his class schedule, emails, grades, and paychecks from his part-time job outside. He often uses public Wi-Fi wherever he finds them.

      <h2>Daily Life</h2>
        <p>
          Since Kenji has a long commute, he uses the time to do many things on the Internet. For convenience, he uses the same password across school, email, and his music subscription. Moreover, to save data usage, he looks for a public wifi whenever he is outside, even if the warning says "unsecure network". He does not use a VPN or antivirus apps. Sometimes he leaves his PC at home and use the university's device or go to internet cafés to do some work, but does not logout when he leaves them.

        <li>Reuses the same password for different logins</li>
        <li>Sometimes forgets to log out on shared computers</li>
