    <h1>Phishing Awareness</h1>

      <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
      <p>
        Phishing is when an attacker pretends to be someone you trust ‚Äî like your university or a bank ‚Äî to trick you into giving away personal info, passwords, or clicking malicious links. Disguising as a known and trusted organization, they may even try to acquire identity documents such as your Passport and licenses. This can result in financial damages, if the attacker decides to use the login credentials you have provided, or the personal information can be used for identity theft and you can be embroiled in crimes.
